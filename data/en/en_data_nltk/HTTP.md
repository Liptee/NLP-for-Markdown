The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distibuted, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wibe Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.

Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and summarized in a simple document describing the behavior of a client and a server using the first HTTP protocol version that was named 0.9.

That first version of HTTP protocol soon evolved into a more elaborated version that was the first draft toward a far future version 1.0.
