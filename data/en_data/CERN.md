The European Organization for Nuclear Rresearch, known as CERN, is a European research organization that operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world. Established in 1954, the organization is based in a northwest suburb of Geneva on the Franco-Swiss border and has 23 member states. Israel is the only non-European country granted full membership. CERN is an official United Nation Observer.

The acronym CERN is also used to refer to the labaratory, which in 2019 had 2,660 scientific, technical, and administrative stuff members, and hosted about 12,400 users from institutions is more than 70 countries. In 2016 CERN generated 49 petabytes of data.

CERN's main function os to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for high-energy physics research - as a result, numerous experiments have been constructed at CERN through international collaborations. CERN is the site pf the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's largest and highest-energy particle collider. The main site at Meyrin hosts a large computing facility, which is primarily used to store and analyse data from experiments, as well as simulate events. Researchers need remote access to these facilities, so the lab has historically been a major wide area network hub. CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web.
